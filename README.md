# Rhythm 3.0
A Discord music bot, rewritten from my previous Python implementation, ([seen here](https://github.com/Palma-Ricardo/KoolCidsMusicBot)).

Both names are taken from the very popular and very successful Rhythm. Due to 
YouTube's policy changes, they were forced to shutdown a few years back, and this
bot aims to fill that void in the mean time for my servers.

I do not recommend using this bot on your own server if you find this. 
Instead, use Jagrosh's [JMusicBot](https://github.com/jagrosh/MusicBot), which is much
more user friendly and has a clear setup guide.
